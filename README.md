This app for Android uses AI to do depthestimation of the image. It saves the depthmap and allows you to "wiggle" the image. You can also create wigglegrams with GIF and extract the depthmap in B/W. 

arm.zip and libx86.zip belong in the lib directory of Archive.zip. Unzip Archive.zip first and afterwards add them all to a zip which ends with the .apk extension. Then it's ready to run!
